/*
  CONTROLLINO - Port Manipulation for MINI, Version 01.01
  The sketch is relevant only for CONTROLLINO variant MINI!

  Turns on and off four digital outputs of CONTROLLINO, which also blinks with CONTROLLINO´s status LEDs for the outputs.
  It explains how to control the microcontroller´s pins directly via port registers.
  This is an alternative to Arduino functions pinMode() and digitalWrite().
  
  This know how may be useful if you need to control the lines in more efficient way.

  Please, see https://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/PortManipulation for some theoretical background.

  IMPORTANT INFORMATION!
  Please, select proper target board in Tools->Board->Controllino MINI before Upload to your CONTROLLINO.
  (Please, refer to https://github.com/CONTROLLINO-PLC/CONTROLLINO_Library if you do not see the CONTROLLINOs in the Arduino IDE menu Tools->Board.)

  This example sketch does not require any additional parts, equipment, wires or power supply. Just your CONTROLLINO, USB cable (type A-B) and a PC.
